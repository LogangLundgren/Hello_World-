# Hello_World-
My first repository!
My name is Logan Lundgren.
I am a freshman at Northwood University in Midland, Michigan.
I am a computer science and data analytics major.
I run cross country and track.
I enjoy reading, playing sports, and learning.
I take part in many student organizations, and I am looking forward to starting a coding club next semester.
